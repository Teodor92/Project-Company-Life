For a detailed information about each feature, please refer to the `User stories` section of this document.

## Technical Stack

The core technical stack for this application should be the MEAN stack. You should use Angular 5/6 for the UI and Express, Node and MongoDB for the server.

## Proposed Architecture

This following section describes a proposed architecture they may or may not be used by the development team.

![Architecture](assets/example-architecture.png)

The suggested architecture is composed of the following sub-projects:

- Front-End - the purpose of this project is to visualize our data take user input while transmitting it to the back-end. This project contains the following sub-components:
        - Angular UI - this component deals ONLY with the visualization of data
        - Service Layer - this is the home of all our data communication logic sending POST/GET/PUT/DELETE requests to the back-end, should be done through here.

- Back-End - the purpose of this project is to abstract any communication with the data source a provide a clean Web API interface for our UI to consume. This project contains the following sub-components:
        - Express Controllers/Routes layer - this component house all the express routing logic and exposes a valid REST CRUD API for our front-end to consume.
        - Service Layer - this the home of all our data storage and validation logic. If we want to store something in our database, we should go through here.

- Data storage - the is the persistent storage for our system - in our case, this is going to be, the Mongo Database.

## General pointers

These ideas bellow are recommendations, that the authors think may be of use to the developers of this system.

- It is highly recommended to use Angular Material([https://material.angular.io/](https://material.angular.io/)) components and NOT write everything from scratch.
- The wireframe images are NOT to be taken as 100% accurate - use imagination and common sense.

## Challenges

If you manage to complete the whole project before the deadline, here are some additional challenges:

- Implement 3rd party authentication using Facebook, Tweeter, Github, and Google.
- Make a new administration for the Job Category and use it to dynamically create job categories.
- Generate a test coverage report for the application.
