# Project Company Life

This repository houses the specification for the Telerik Academy Alpha graduation project (2019). Although this was created as a graduation task, this project is suitable for programmers that just want to practice.

You are more than welcome to open an Issue if there is something unclear in the specification.

## Where to start?

You can start by looking through the basic overview of the project in the [README.md](./specification/README.md) file.
